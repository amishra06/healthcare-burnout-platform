# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Healthcare Worker Burnout Prevention Platform is a web application designed to help healthcare managers proactively monitor staff workload and prevent burnout through automated risk assessment and early intervention alerts. The platform provides real-time visibility into staff work patterns, calculates burnout risk scores using evidence-based algorithms, and enables managers to take preventive action before burnout occurs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want to securely log into the platform, so that I can access staff workload data and burnout risk information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the dashboard
2. WHEN a manager enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent access
3. WHEN a manager session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
4. IF a manager is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prevent access to protected routes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want to view a comprehensive dashboard showing staff burnout risk overview, so that I can quickly identify high-risk situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a visual overview of all staff risk levels
2. WHEN staff have active alerts THEN the system SHALL prominently display alert notifications on the dashboard
3. WHEN displaying risk data THEN the system SHALL show the top 5 highest-risk staff members with their current scores
4. WHEN risk levels change THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard display in real-time
5. IF no staff data exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want to track individual staff work hours including overtime, so that I can monitor workload patterns and identify potential burnout risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager enters work hours for a staff member THEN the system SHALL store the date, regular hours, and overtime hours
2. WHEN work hours are entered THEN the system SHALL validate that hours are within reasonable limits (0-24 per day)
3. WHEN overtime hours exceed normal limits THEN the system SHALL flag this in the risk calculation
4. WHEN viewing staff details THEN the system SHALL display historical work hour patterns
5. IF work hours are missing for recent dates THEN the system SHALL indicate incomplete data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want the system to automatically calculate burnout risk scores for each staff member, so that I can objectively assess burnout likelihood.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN work hours are updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate the burnout risk score using the defined algorithm
2. WHEN calculating risk scores THEN the system SHALL apply the following scoring rules:
   - Base score of 20 points
   - Add 10 points per consecutive work day (maximum 30 points)
   - Add 15 points per overtime hour this week (maximum 25 points)
   - Add 20 points if more than 60 hours worked this week
   - Add 5 points per weekend worked this month (maximum 15 points)
3. WHEN risk score is calculated THEN the system SHALL categorize risk level as Low (0-40), Medium (41-70), or High (71-100)
4. WHEN risk scores change THEN the system SHALL update the database with the new score and timestamp
5. IF calculation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and maintain the previous score

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want to receive automated email notifications for high-risk staff situations, so that I can take immediate preventive action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a staff member's risk score reaches High level (71-100) THEN the system SHALL send an email notification to the manager
2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL include staff name, current risk score, and key contributing factors
3. WHEN multiple staff reach high risk simultaneously THEN the system SHALL send a consolidated notification
4. WHEN a high-risk situation is resolved (score drops below 71) THEN the system SHALL send a follow-up notification
5. IF email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry sending

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want to view detailed staff profiles with risk breakdowns and work history, so that I can understand the specific factors contributing to burnout risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager clicks on a staff member THEN the system SHALL display their detailed profile page
2. WHEN viewing staff details THEN the system SHALL show current risk score with breakdown of contributing factors
3. WHEN displaying work history THEN the system SHALL show recent work hours, overtime patterns, and consecutive work days
4. WHEN viewing risk trends THEN the system SHALL display historical risk scores using charts and graphs
5. IF staff data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL indicate missing information and its impact on risk calculation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want to add and manage staff information, so that I can maintain accurate records for burnout monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager adds new staff THEN the system SHALL require name, email, department, role, and hire date
2. WHEN staff information is updated THEN the system SHALL validate email format and required fields
3. WHEN viewing staff list THEN the system SHALL display all staff organized by department
4. WHEN staff are added to different departments THEN the system SHALL support ICU, Emergency, and General departments
5. IF duplicate email addresses are entered THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and display an error message

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want to use the platform on both desktop and mobile devices, so that I can monitor staff burnout risks regardless of my location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the platform on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for small screens
2. WHEN using touch interactions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and gestures
3. WHEN viewing charts on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt visualizations for smaller screen sizes
4. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality across platforms
5. IF screen size is very small THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical information and hide secondary details

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want to view visual charts and graphs of burnout risk data, so that I can easily identify trends and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display risk distribution charts showing staff across risk levels
2. WHEN viewing staff details THEN the system SHALL show individual risk trend charts over time
3. WHEN displaying work hour data THEN the system SHALL use bar charts to show daily and weekly patterns
4. WHEN charts are interactive THEN the system SHALL allow hovering/clicking for detailed information
5. IF chart data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a healthcare manager, I want the system to include realistic sample data, so that I can immediately evaluate the platform's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is first deployed THEN it SHALL include 15 sample healthcare staff members
2. WHEN sample data is created THEN it SHALL include staff distributed across ICU, Emergency, and General departments
3. WHEN viewing sample data THEN it SHALL show 2 weeks of realistic work hours demonstrating various risk scenarios
4. WHEN sample risk scores are calculated THEN they SHALL demonstrate Low, Medium, and High risk examples
5. IF sample data conflicts with real data THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear or preserve sample records
